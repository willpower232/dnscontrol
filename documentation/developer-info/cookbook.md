## Create a `models.DomainConfig`

- What: Create a `models.DomainConfig`
- Why: Providers are handed a `models.DomainConfig` that is already created. However often when we write tests we need to create a list of `models.RecordConfig`'s which are stored in a `models.DomainConfig`.

Recommended:

```go
dc, err := models.NewDomainConfig(zone)
dc.AddTestRC(t, label, ttl, type, arg, arg1, arg2, ...)
dc.AddTestRCParse(t, label, ttl, type, arg)
fmt.Printf("Count: %d", len(dc.Records))

// Make individual RCs:
rc1 := dc.MustNewRecordConfig(label, ttl, type, arg, arg1, arg2, ...)
rc2 := dc.MustNewRecordConfigParse(label, ttl, type, arg)
```

Deprecated:

```go
dc := &models.DomainConfig{Name: origin}
```

## Create a `models.RecordConfig`

- What: Create a `models.RecordConfig`
- Why: One of the most important functions of a provider is to translate the native DNS records (as received from the API) to standard `models.RecordConfig` structs. Previously there were many ways to do this. Starting in DNSControl v5, we've standaredized on two factories:

Recommended:

```go
rc1, err := dc.NewRecordConfig(LABEL, TTL, TYPE_STR_OR_NUM, ARGS...)
rc2, err := dc.NewRecordConfigParse(LABEL, TTL, TYPE_STR_OR_NUM, RFC1038_STRING)
```

- These are a method of `models.DomainConfig` (typically the variable name is `dc`). Records only exist in the context of a domain. For example, if an MX record's target it "@", this is meaningless unless we know what the domain is. This also makes the call shorter: it eliminates parameters that contain info already stored in `dc` such as the zone name (required for normalizing labels).
- `NewRecordConfig()` takes a list of arguments. It doesn't matter if the arguments are strings, ints, `netip.Addrs`... the function will convert them to the correct type and return and error if they can't be converted.
- `NewRecordConfigParse()` takes the arguments as one long string, which is parsed. If your provider returns (for example) the MX record data as `10 mx.example.com.` and the SRV record data as `4 100 123 three.example.com.`, you can just send the whole string to this function. This replaces `models.PopulateFromString()`

- `LABEL`: Must be the output of one of these functions:
  - `dc.LabelFromShort()`: Use this if your provider always gives you the shortname (`foo` of `foo.example.com`)
  - `dc.LabelFromFQDNNoDot()`: Use this if your provider always gives you the FQDN (`foo.example.com`)
  - `dc.LabelFromFQDNWithDot()`: Use this if your provider always gives you the FQDN+"." (`foo.example.com.`)
- Which to use?
  - Unsurer? Try LabelFromFQDNWithDot() and watch for errors. They often suggest what function to use.
  - Errors like `DEBUG: LabelFromFQDNWithDot(quux.a.dnscontrol-azure.com) called WRONG.'
  - In this case, the hostname (`quux.a.dnscontrol-azure.com`) indicates `LabelFromFQDNNoDot` is more appropriate.
  - If you see a shortname, use `dc.LabelFromShort()`
  - If the integration tests for IGNORE() fail, you've probably picked the wrong function.
- Why 3 functions? Can't NewRecordConfig figure it out?
  - There are ambiguous cases that make it impossible to guess with 100 percent accurately.
  - It is faster and more accurate to simply have multiple functions, one for each situation.
  - The truth is that your provider's API is going to only deliver the label one way. They're not going to change.

- `TTL` must be the desired TTL or `0` if it is unknown. Unknown TTLs are converted into the default TTL.

- `TYPE_STR_OR_NUM` can be either the record type's codepoint or a string:
  - codepoint: e.g. `dnsv2.TypeA`, `dnsv2.TypeMX`, `dnsv2.TypeCNAME`, `privatetypes.CLOUDFLAREAPISINGLEREDIRECT`
  - string (`"A"`, `"MX"`, `"CNAME"`, `"CLOUDFLAREAPI_SINGLE_REDIRECT"`)
  - Please use the constant when possible. Eventually we'll eliminate the strings. However, if all you have is the string, please let the factory do the conversion for you.

- `ARGS` is a list of fields in the order they appear in the struct.  The type doesn't matter as they will be converted automatically.  No need to convert strings to ints and so on. Even IP addresses are handled properly. Examples:
  - `dc.NewRecordConfig("mxhost", 0, dnsv2.TypeMX, "10", "mx.example.com.")`
  - `dc.NewRecordConfig("mxback", 0, dnsv2.TypeMX, 20, "mx2.example.com.")`
  - `dc.NewRecordConfig("www", 0, dnsv2.TypeA, "1.2.3.4")`
  - `addr, _ := netip.ParseAddr("192.168.1.1"); dc.NewRecordConfig("www", 0, dnsv2.TypeA, addr)`
  - `dc.NewRecordConfig("public", 0, dnsv2.TypeLOC, 42, 21, 54, "N", 71, 6, 18, "W", -24.05, 30, 0, 0)`
  - `dc.NewRecordConfig("public", 0, dnsv2.TypeLOC, "42", "21", "54", "N", "71", "6", "18", "W", "-24.05", 30, "0", 0)`

- `RFC1038_STRING` is a string that is parsed like the fields in a ZoneFile
  - `dc.NewRecordConfigParse("mxhost", 0, dnsv2.TypeMX, "10 mx.example.com.")`
  - `dc.NewRecordConfigParse("mxback", 0, dnsv2.TypeMX, "20 mx2.example.com.")`
  - `dc.NewRecordConfigParse("www", 0, dnsv2.TypeA, "1.2.3.4")`
  - `dc.NewRecordConfigParse("public", 0, dnsv2.TypeLOC, "42 21 54 N 71 6 18 W -24.05 30 0 0)`

Typically either `dc.NewRecordConfig()` or `dc.NewRecordConfigParse()` will satisfy all of your needs.  However occasionally there are situations where a particular record type needs special handling.  We recommend using a switch statement to handle the special case.

In this example, `*Parse` works just fine for all cases except `MX` records. Therefore, we process `MX` records first as a special case:

```go
    switch rtype {
      case dnsv2.TypeMX:
        preference := extractPreference(nativeRec)
        target := extractTarget(nativeRec)
        rc, err := dc.NewRecordConfig(label, ttl, dnsv2.TypeMX, preference, target)
      default:
        rc, err := dc.NewRecordConfigParse(label, 0, rtype, combined_fields)
    }
    if err != nil {
      return err
    }
    dc.AddRecord(rc)
```

Deprecated:

Please do not create your own `RecordConfig`'s:

```go
rc := &models.RecordConfig{Name: label, Type: "MX"}
rc.MxPreference = pref
...
```

## Getters/Setters for RDATA in `models.RecordConfig`

The fields of a DNS record are called the `RDATA` (resource data).

Accessing the RDATA using the `.GetRDATA()` getter, and the `.SetRDATA()` setter.

`.GetRDATA()`) returns the generic interface (`dnsv2.RDATA`).  The `.String()` function generates a zonefile-like string representing every field in the struct:

```go
rd := rc.GetRDATA()     // The generic RDATA
fmt.Printf("Like in a zonefile: %s\n", rd.String())
```

Generally you then need to cast it to the correct type.

```go
rd := rc.GetRDATA()             // The generic RDATA
mx1 := rc.GetRDATA().(dnsv2.MX)  // Cast as a MX so we can work with it.
mx2 := rc.AsMX()                 // Same as mx1, but less typing.
```

Typical useage:

```go
switch rtype {
case "MX":
    mx = rc.AsMX()
case "SRV":
    srv = rc.AsSRV()
case "CLOUDFLAREAPI_SINGLE_REDIRECT":
    csr = rc.AsCLOUDFLAREAPISINGLEREDIRECT()
}
```

```go
mx := rc.AsMX() // Cast to the MX record
fmt.Printf("my MX is preference=%d target=%q\n", mx.Preference, mx.Mx)
fmt.Printf("Like in a zonefile: %s\n", mx.String()) // Same as rd.String()
```

To alter fields call `GetRDATA()`, change the fields, then call `SetRDATA()` to save it back.  `GetRDATA()` returns a copy of the RDATA, therefore mutating it without saving it back is fruitless.

```go
rd := rc.AsMX()       // Get the RDATA, cast as an MX
mx.Preference = 999   // Alter a field.
rc.SetRDATA(mx)       // Save it back.
```

## Create `models.RecordConfig` literals for testdata

This is for creating test data only. They panic on error.

```go
dc, err := models.NewDomainConfig(zone)
dc.AddTestRC("www", 0, dnsv2.TypeA, "1.2.3.4")
dc.AddTestRC("mail", 0, dnsv2.TypeMX, 10, "mx1.example.com.")
dc.AddTestRCParse("mail", 0, dnsv2.TypeMX, "20 mx2.example.com.")
```

If you want to create an `models.RecordConfig` without adding it to a `dc`, there are `Must` versions
of `dc.NewRecordConfig()` and `dc.NewRecordConfigParse()`:

```go
dc, err := models.NewDomainConfig(zone)
rc0 := dc.MustNewRecordConfig("www", 0, dnsv2.TypeA, "1.2.3.4")
rc1 := dc.MustNewRecordConfig("mail", 0, dnsv2.TypeMX, 10, "mx1.example.com.")
rc2 := dc.MustNewRecordConfigParse("mail", 0, dnsv2.TypeMX, "20 mx2.example.com.")
```

## How to create a "builder"

A builder is a function that can be used in `dnsconfig.js` which outputs one or
more DNS records. For example, the `SPF_BUILDER()` function generates `TXT`
records.

Assume the builder is named "robert" and appears in `dnsconfig.js` as `ROBERT(label, data)`

- Create the builder in `models/b_robert.go`
. Register the builder:

```go
func init() {
        RegisterBuilder("LOC", BuilderLOC)
}
```

(see `models/b_loc.go` for an example)

- Create the `BuilderNAME()` function

Add a function called BuilderROBERT() with this signature:

```go
func BuilderROBERT(dc *DomainConfig, ttl uint32, args []any, metadata map[string]string, subdomain string) (Records, error) {
```

- `dc`: The domain the builder was called in.
- `ttl`: the desired TTL or `0` if it is unknown. Unknown TTLs are converted into the default TTL.
- `args`: the arguments passed to the function in `dnsconfig.js`. Each should be passed through a `mustbe.*` function before use.
- `metadata`: Any `{foo: "foo"}` (Javascript objects) passed to the function in `dnsconfig.js`.
- `subdomain`: If the builder was used in a `D_EXTEND()`, the subdomain will be non-nil.
  - If `D("example.com")` is followed by `D_EXTEND("foo.example.com")`, subdomain will be `foo`.
  - To calculate the label: `name, _ := dc.LabelFromDnsconfigjs(args[0].(string), subdomain)`
  - To calcuate a target name: `name, _ := mustbe.TagetHostWithSubdoman(dc.Name, subdomain, name)`

The builder function can do basically anything and generate as many records as it wants. `SPF_BUILDER()` returns many records. `LOC()` returns just one record.

All builders must have unit tests.

## How to manipulate domain/zone names

Rather than use strings.Trim() or other functions, use these functions. They
handle "@", apex domains, and other edge cases properly. See the unit tests for
examples.

Turn a short name (`foo`) into a FQDN (`foo.example.com.`) (with trailing dot).

```go
f1 := nameutil.ToFqdnWithDot("foo", "example.com")
f2 := dc.ToFqdnWithDot("foo")         // Assume dc.Name = "example.com"
# result: foo.example.com.
# The result will always end in ".".
```

Turn a short name (`foo`) into a FQDN (`foo.example.com`) (no trailing dot).

```go
f1 := nameutil.ToFqdnNoDot("foo", "example.com")
f2 := dc.ToFqdnNoDot("foo")           // Assume dc.Name = "example.com"
# result: foo.example.com
# The result will never end in "." (even if the origin did).
```

Turn a name (FQDN end with a ".") into a shortname:

```go
short1 := nameutil.ToShort("foo.example.com.", "example.com")
short2 := dc.ToShort("foo.example.com.")    // Assume dc.Name = "example.com"
# result: foo
# The result ends in "." if it is a FQDN (even if the origin didn't.)
```

## What you should know about TXT records

The DNS protocol stores a TXT record as a series of segements:

- Each segment can be a maximum of 255-octets (octets == bytes).
- It's possible to have no segments.
- It's possible to zero-length segments.
- In a DNS Zone File, TXT records are presented as quoted strings (each segment quoted individually), with \DDD (3-digit) escapes for non-printing chars and \x (1-char escapes) for literals (typically `\\` to represent a backslach and `\"` to represent a double-quote inside a quoted string).

DNSControl stores TXT records as segments. However...

- We "re-segment" strings so that all but the last one is 255-octets.
- Zero-length segments are removed.
- Records with no segments are "improved" to have a single 0-length segment. This eliminates an edge case to deal with.

To manage this, we have getters and setters that assure the above rules happen transparently.

### TXT functions

Reading TXT data:

```go
j := rc.GetTargetTXTJoined() // One big string
s := rc.GetTargetTXTSegmented() // []string with each element 255-octets except the last.
```

Creating TXT records from scratch:

```go
rc1, err := dc.NewRecordConfig(LABEL, TTL, dnsv2.TypeTXT, "raw bytes")
rc2, err := dc.NewRecordConfigParse(LABEL, TTL, dnsv2.TypeTXT, `"quoted" "like" "from" "zonefile"`)
```

Updating existing records:

- `SetTargetTXT(string)`:  Takes one (possibly long) string.
- `SetTargetTXTs([]string)`: Takes a []string.  Will re-segment if needed.

FYI: The above functions will re-segment the text such that each segment is 255
octets long, except the last one which contains the remainder. If a record is
(for example) 3 segments of length 200, 200, and 200 each, they will be merged
and resegmented to lengths 255, 255, and 90.

Please do not use `rc.GetTargetField()` on TXT records.

## How to change the rtype of a RecordConfig

Suppose you have a models.RecordConfig{} but the type needs to change.
For example, the provider doesn't support ALIAS but they call it a CNAME.

```go
    rc = rc.ChangeTypeToCNAME(dc, rc.AsALIAS().Target)
```

For any other transformation:

1. Set .Type and .TypeNum

2. Create the RDATA using a MakeFOO() function and use the SetRDATA() to store it.  Be sure to use SetDATA() last since it rebuilds any pre-computed strings.

Example:

```go
rec.Type = "AKAMAITLC"
rec.TypeNum = privatetypes.TypeAKAMAITLC
rd, err := privatetypesrdata.MakeAKAMAITLC(dc.Name, nil, nrc.Flags{}, "DUAL", target)
if err != nil {
    return err
}
rec.SetRDATA(rd)
```

Doing it this way preserves all other fields such as `.Metadata`.

## How to label imports

To avoid confusion between old and new DNS modules, we always import them with explicit `v1` and `v2` names.

Here is the canonical list:

```go
import (
    dnsv1 "github.com/miekg/dns"
    dnsv2 "codeberg.org/miekg/dns"
    dnsutilv1 "github.com/miekg/dns/dnsutil"
    dnsutilv2 "codeberg.org/miekg/dns/dnsutil"
    dnsrdatav2 "codeberg.org/miekg/dns/rdata"
    dnstestv2 "codeberg.org/miekg/dns/dnstest"
    svcbv1 "github.com/miekg/dns/svcb"
    svcbv2 "codeberg.org/miekg/dns/svcb"
)
```
